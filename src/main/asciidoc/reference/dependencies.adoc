The easiest way to find compatible versions of Spring Vault dependencies is by inspecting the properties section of link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-vault/blob/main/pom.xml[`spring-vault-parent`].
We generally recommend upgrading to the latest dependency of Jackson, your HTTP clients and your Cloud provider SDK.

[[dependencies.spring-framework]]
== Spring Framework

The current version of Spring Vault requires Spring Framework in version
{springVersion} or newer.
The modules might also work with an older bugfix version of that minor version.
However, using the most recent version within that generation is highly recommended.
